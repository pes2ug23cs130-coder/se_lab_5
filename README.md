Hello! This is a simple inventory management script written in Python. 
It can add items, remove items, and save/load the inventory to a JSON file.

The original code was full of bugs, security holes, and messy style. ðŸ˜±
The main goal was to use static analysis tools to find and fix all the problems. 
I used:
Pylint: For finding bugs and style errors.
Flake8: For more style checks (PEP 8).
Bandit: For finding security issues (like that nasty eval()!).

ðŸŒŸ The Result ðŸŒŸ
After a lot of fixing, this code is now sparkling clean and scored a 9.83/10 on Pylint! 
How to Run
Run it from your terminal:
python inventory_system.py
